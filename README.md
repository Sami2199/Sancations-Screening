## Introduction

Sanctions screening is a control used in the detection, prevention and disruption of financial crime and,in particular, sanctions risk. It is the comparison of one string of text against another to detect similarities which would suggest a possible match. It compares data sourced from an FI’s operations,such as customer and transactional records, against lists of names and other indicators of sanctioned parties or locations.
